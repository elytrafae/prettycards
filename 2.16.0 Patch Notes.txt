- Added ranked reward claiming to the Game End screen
- Added theme song randomization setting! Now you can make PrettyCards' vast array of available theme songs play in random order!
- Interactive card hovers! A feature I made long ago that I forgot why I never released... So, here it is!

- "Fixed" an error happening when you buy your last artifact with PrettyCards
- Fixed artifact ownership checks breaking in the latest update
- Fixed an issue where half of "Floating Soul" images discarded fallbacks
- Updated songs on the Game End screen
- Fixed ELOs and divisions again! Now most of the data should be pulled from the game itself to avoid issues stemming from things being out of sync 
- Fixed issues with several instances of audio playing from PrettyCards when the setting for them has been turned off
- Fixed missing artifact data preventing people from seeing artifacts. Instead, the system will fall back to Undercards' default screen
- Fixed several places not recognizing UTY as an extension
-
