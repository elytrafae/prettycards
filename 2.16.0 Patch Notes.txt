- The Game End Screen displaying cards as plural when collecting quests is (hopefully) fixed!
- Hopefully fixed switch stuff trying to be erroniously loaded (https://discord.com/channels/330092826513899530/959722428592971856/1271803065930088541)
- Fixed card jingle stuff not listening to Underscript's settings all the time
- Added a setting to control whether ot not you want theme songs to be pre-loaded. It's on by default (current behaviour)
- Changed mid-game preload behavior (will only preload the first song, and if that's played then the second etc.) (The exception to this is cards with special rules) (needs testing)
- Mettaton NEO no longer has 13 themes and no longer has a special rule
- Theme song previews had some small changes in UI. CSS should also be faster now
- Gold, Dust and XP tick faster on the Custom Game End Screen
- Fixed packs images being kinda all over the place
