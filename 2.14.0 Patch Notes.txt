- Major refactor: Changed from the deprecated appendCard() event to the new func:appendCard event, which should reduce lag (due to all of the spammed warning messages). If card related features randomly break this update, contact me!
- Added April Fools 2023 Skins for deck selection
- Added the ability to craft cards in the decks page!
- Hovering over a card's name in a shiny card now properly makes the hovered card shiny!
- The text on card skin showcases is not resized properly

TODO:
- Interactive Card Helper (finish this)
- Add more Hourglass GIFs.
- Add minimalistic version of deck system (?)
- Cosmetics Wishlist (Possibly with Discord integration?)
- Make Game End Screen look actually decent

- Resource Packs
- Animation Upgrades
- Multiple Settings for HD Settings
- Remake Lobby Games
- "Would You Rather" for April.
- Fun Value (Especially for Card Descriptions)
