- Added a feature to hide the footer at will.
- Card Friendship data is now visible on the Crafting and Deck pages, too.
- Added "Open Settings" option to the PrettyCards menu.
- Add way to collapse the Friendship Data on User Profiles by clicking on the title. The decision is saved.

- Reworked a bit the translation system. I added the ability to have multiple sources and multiple preview types during editing.
- Solved card mentions in some places being in plural!
- Some small design changes and fixes.
- Opened up some of the API.


TODO:
- Add minimalistic version of deck system (?)
