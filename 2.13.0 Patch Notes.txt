- Adjusted Breaking Skin Fix according to announcement.
- Solved critical issue in adding a friend through PrettyCards causing my alt account to be added instead of the intended target.
- Snoelle and The Heroine theme fix due to their (relatively) recent balance changes (DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO FULLY TEST, BUT IT SHOULDN'T BREAK THE WHOLE SCRIPT, EVEN IF I MESSED UP THE MATH)
- Disabling Switch Highlights will now (visually) disable the colors on the cards as well!
- Added UC:O card icon
- Added HD artifacts (partially) (too bad April Fools images take priority lol)
