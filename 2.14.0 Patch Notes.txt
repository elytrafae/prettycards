- Major refactor: Changed from the depracated appendCard() event to the new func:appendCard event, which should reduce lag (due to all of the spammed warning messages). If card related features randomly break this update, contact me!
- Added April Fools 2023 Skins for deck selection

TODO:
- Crafting cards in the Decks page (FINISH AND OPTIMIZE!? Note: The reason I need to keep a copy of the collection is so that cards in a specific deck won't skrew stuff up + faster than searching in the global collection variable)
- Interactive Card Helper (finish this)
- Add more Hourglass GIFs.
- Add minimalistic version of deck system (?)
- Cosmetics Wishlist (Possibly with Discord integration?)
- Make Game End Screen look actually decent

- Resource Packs
- Animation Upgrades
- Multiple Settings for HD Settings
- Remake Lobby Games
- "Would You Rather" for April.
- Fun Value (Especially for Card Descriptions)
