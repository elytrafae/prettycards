- Added Switch Highlighting. The Translation team helped me make sure this works for multiple languages!
- Added HD Card Skins (optional, check settings to turn off, as I would understand under various circumstances for it to be turned off). I would like to thank the artist team for helping me with this one!
- Added a feature to the Crafting Page that allows you to craft cards based on a deck code. It's called Mass Crafting.
- PrettyCards is now Translated to multiple languages. I would like to thank the Translator team for their support on this one!
- Gerson is now properly highlighted. This is also thanks to the Translation Team!
- Emotes now have Sound Effects when used during a game! Thanks go out to MysteryHD for the sound effects.

- Improved the caching algorithm for the Multiple Theme Song system (unless in the Game or Spectator pages) so that it doesn't load everything if it doesn't have to.
- Default Rarity Icons are now pre-loaded.
- Improved the Favorite Cards UI for the User Profile viewer. Now, it can show the top 8 cards for a person, instead of 2, and the type of ranking can be toggled.
- Major balance changes for my DDLC set.
- Added UCO Ideas set because IDK.
- Fixed the "End of season rewards" text on the play page not rendering properly for everyone due to race conditions.
- Numerous minor bug fixes.
- IDK, some things I probably forgot. This has been MONTHS in the making!

- Unfortunately, no major improvements this time. Occasional lag spikes are under investigation, but sadly I cannot get them consistently enough to get anywhere.
